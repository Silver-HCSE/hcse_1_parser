# Hallmarks of cancer search engine part 1

## Overview

This is the first part of a multi-part project to build a search engine for cancer publications entirely from the ground up in rust. Rust dependencies are allowed, but we will not use any pre-trained models or similar. Instead, we will use some classical numerics and build all the parts ourselves as an exercise in real-world problem solving. 

## This module

This repository contains the code of the parser. The parser reads the publicly available data of the PubMed online archive to generate a base dataset for further work.

## The project

There will be articles on Medium and videos on Youtube which I will link here once the project is done. Until then, this is a work-in-progress.

## Next steps

The next step will be to use the data generated by this tool to build a grading system for a hallmark-grading vector (which I will explain in some more detail in the secondary content).

## Contributing

You can do a lot for this project. Firstly, if you like it, say so on Medium.com and Youtube. It helps me by making the content more likely to be promoted.
Secondly, this is an open-source project and I use GitHub to allow people to a) open issues and b) contribute to the development.
Feel free to do both.

Lastly, if you enjoy this project, tell a friend about it - maybe they will like it, too.
